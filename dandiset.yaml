description: 'In these recordings, we test different intensities and PRFs (pulse repetition
  frequencies) of ultrasound stimulation using a phased ultrasound array to stimulate
  the somatosensory cortex of rats anesthetized with 2% isoflurane through inhalation.
  Recordings are taken using 32 channel Neuronexus electrodes. Ultrasound stimulation
  is delivered every 2.5 seconds, and each recording has either 200 or 500 trials. '
